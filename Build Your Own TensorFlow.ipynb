    "In this lab, you’ll build a library called miniflow which will be your own version of [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org/)! TensorFlow is one of the most popular open source neural network libraries, built by the team at Google Brain just over the last few years. Through building this lab, you’ll be able to better understand backpropagation, the engine behind neural networks. We’ll finally use this library that you built to [classify digits in handwriting](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)! This will be a very hands on and interactive experience - let’s get started!"

    "Following this lab, all other neural network type of activities will done with [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org/) and [higher-level APIs](https://keras.io/) in its ecosystem. So why bother with this lab then? Good question, glad you asked!\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to demistify two concepts at the heart of network networks - backpropagation and differentiable graphs. Backpropagation is the process by which we update the weight of our network over time. You may have seen it in [this video](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/fbf77062-5703-404e-b60c-95b78b2f3f9e/modules/6df7ae49-c61c-4bb2-a23e-6527e69209ec/lessons/59e94b37-ef38-43ff-acd4-4c7f5326cff5/concepts/4320886810923#) in the previous lesson. Differentiable graphs are graphs where the nodes are [differentiable functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function). They are also very useful as a *visual aid* for understanding and calculating complicated derivatives. This is the fundamental abstraction of TensorFlow, it's a framework for creating these type of graphs. With this understanding, we will be able to create our own nodes and properly compute the derivatives. Even more importantly, we will be able to think and reason in terms of these graphs.\n",

    "We can think of a neural network as a composition of functions with a **loss** (number) as the output. This number can also be thought of as an *error term*, the larger the value the larger our error. Our goal is to get the error as close to 0 as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L = f_n(f_{n-1}(...f_1(x)...))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, out of the box a neural network isn't all that useful. Its predictions will at this point will just be noise. We need to be able to train the **neural network to produce the correct output**. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, what do we have control of? Our inputs? Nope. Our inputs are the data which itself can vary significantly, but we could also change our dataset entirely. We need something that sticks around, something stateful that also affects the output. \n",
    "\n",
    "What about our weights? \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, That's exactly it! We can change our weights. They stay static unless we change them. Alright, now we have another question.\n",
    "\n",
    "How we do alter our weights?\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively we'd like to see what effect a weight had on the output and make a change based on that. If it played a large role in the error then we should alter it by a large amount. If it didn't play a significant role in the error, then it's probably already set to a good value and we should, for the most part, let it be.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we formalize this idea?\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily for us, this idea is already well established in mathematical literature where it's known as **reverse-mode differentiation** or **backpropagation**. The name sounds very scary but it's actually not so bad. It essentially boils down to computing derivatives and using the chain rule. For example, say we wanted to compute the gradient of the loss function $L$ with respect to a weight $W_{kj}$. Here $W$ is a matrix of weights so $W_{kj}$ is an individual weight (number) at row $k$, column $j$ of $W$. Let's assume $W$ is an input/argument to the function $f_1$, meaning $f_1$ does some computation with $W$, the exact computation doesn't matter right now.\n",

    "\n",

    "#### Quick Aside: Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed in the above link they used the following notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac {d}{dx} f(g(x)) = f'(g(x))g'(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac {\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \n",
    "\\frac {\\partial f}{\\partial g} \\frac {\\partial g} {\\partial x}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter notation is used when we talk about *partial derivatives*, that is, we want measure the effect a specific input had on our output. This is precisely what we're going to be doing throughout this lab so we'll use the latter notation. By the way, the $\\partial$ symbol is called a *partial*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, now back to our our friend $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W_{kj}}$. This is mathematical speak for, \"what effect did weight $W_{kj}$ have on the output $L$?\" You might be wondering why we need to know all these other partials. Why can't we just write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W_{kj}} = \n",
    "\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial f_1}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial W_{kj}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "since $W_{kj}$ is the input to $f_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we did that we would miss out on a wealth of information and most likely get an incorrect gradient. Remember that $f_1$ affects $f_2$ and $f_3$ affects $f_4$ and ... you get the point. Missing out on how all these intermediate functions affect each other won't do us any good and it'll only get worse the more intermediate functions we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in a sense we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W_{kj}} = \n",
    "\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial f_1}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial W_{kj}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "but just remember that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial f_1} =\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial f_n}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial f_n}{\\partial f_n}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial f_n}{\\partial f_{n-1}}\n",
    "...\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial f_1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
